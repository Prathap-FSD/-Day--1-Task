Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2
The world of web communication has seen significant advancements over the years. One of the most impactful developments in recent times has been the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2. 
These protocols underpin the foundation of the World Wide Web, and understanding the differences between them is crucial for web developers, system administrators, and anyone interested in web performance optimization.

HTTP/1.1: The Old Workhorse
HTTP/1.1, the 1.1 version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, has been the backbone of the web for over a decade. 
While it served its purpose well, it had limitations that needed to be addressed as the web evolved.

Header Blocking: 
In HTTP/1.1, all resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) were fetched sequentially. 
This meant that if a resource further down the line was slow to load, it would block the loading of subsequent resources. This 'head-of-line' blocking resulted in slower page load times

HTTP/2: A Modern Solution
HTTP/2 was developed to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and to improve the efficiency of web communication. Here are some key differences:
Multiplexing: HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single connection. 
This eliminates the head-of-line blocking problem and significantly speeds up page loading.

Header Compression: HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce redundant data in header fields. This results in a reduced overhead for each request and response, making the communication more efficient.
Server Push:HTTP/2 supports server push, enabling the server to proactively send resources to the client before they are explicitly requested. This reduces the number of round-trips and speeds up page loading.
Stream Prioritization: HTTP/2 allows for stream prioritization, which lets the client specify the order in which it would like to receive resources. This helps ensure that critical resources are delivered first.
Connection Reuse: HTTP/2 encourages connection reuse, reducing the need to establish new connections for each request, which further decreases latency.

Testing and Optimization: Even with HTTP/2, optimizing your website for performance remains important. Compress resources, use efficient coding practices, and prioritize critical content.
